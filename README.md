# Humanities Commons

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mlaa/humanities-commons.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mlaa/humanities-commons)

This is a WordPress plugin to implement BuddyPress functions, filters and actions for the [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org) multi-network setup. There is a separate repository for the HC WordPress application using this plugin: [mlaa/commons](https://github.com/mlaa/commons).

## Required Dependencies

These are absolultely required, but probably not all you will need.

[Shibboleth](https://github.com/mlaa/shibboleth) HC maintains a fork of mitcho's shibboleth plugin.

## Other Dependencies

We're still working on generalizing a lot of this code, so some dependencies may not be breaking and may change in the near future. In the meantime the most complete and current list of dependencies is in the main [composer.json](https://github.com/mlaa/commons/blob/master/composer.json) for Humanities Commons.
